# GSAP (Greensock.js) Animation Basics

This is a page showing some basic animations with GSAP. When you click the shop link, the main photo moves to the right, the menu extends down the left side of the screen, and the images and sub-menu are available.

This page was created by following the YouTube video example by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyrIPCs47A).
